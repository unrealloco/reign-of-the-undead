# Vision #

Our goal is to make a game that is difficult to win.  It should never be a forgone conclusion that you will win the game.  The toughest maps should be nigh impossible to beat, and the average map should always be touch-and-go.  At the same time, we want to ensure enough configurabilty so that the game can be made far easier for those server owners that prefer an easier game.

We do not like cheating, glitching, and poor team players, and we have gone through a lot of effort to mitigate opportunities for cheating and glitching.  Likewise, we have taken efforts to reward good team players, and to punish poor team players.

We will consider implementing features that server owners and players request.  However, we will not implement features that make a mockery of the game or facilitate cheating such as god mode, uber weapons with unlimited ammo, and similar.  If you want such 'features', you are welcome to modify the source code to implement them yourself, but we aren't going to do it for you.
