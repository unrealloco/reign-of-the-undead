This document contains information helpful for map-makers.

### Sample `*`.gsc File ###
New maps, and existing maps that are updated, should follow this [example](http://code.google.com/p/reign-of-the-undead/source/browse/trunk/map_src/contrib/test_map/raw/maps/mp/mp_surv_testmap.gsc) file for their script files.  Doing so will prevent the **very** common precache errors and help with debugging.
