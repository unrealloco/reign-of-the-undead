# RotU Development #

The intended audience for this section is fellow developers of the Reign of the Undead (RotU) project.  It is expected that you have significant programming experience in some language, are able to read documentation, and are able to Google to help fill in missing pieces.  Even though this section is geared towards project members, most of this material will apply to those that want to modify and build their own custom  versions for use on their own servers.
